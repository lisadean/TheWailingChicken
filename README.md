# TheWailingChicken

http://thewailingchicken.com

Commerative souvenir for the DigitalCrafts June 2018 cohort. Turns out that, if you take this [chicken](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071CG16QW) apart, and blow into the tube you find, you can make some truly tortured chicken noises. The classroom next door was subjected to daily hazing with the chicken. Now the whole internet can be, too.
